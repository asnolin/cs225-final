\section*{Simply Typed Lambda Calculus with Exceptions}
We propose to implement a semantics and type checker for the simply typed lambda calculus extended with exception terms (errors, try, exceptions).

\paragraph{Expected Challenges}
We expect a challenge to be adding in helper functions to help implement the exception extensions to the language. In the homeworks, these were always provided for us and they seem difficult to incorporate. Also, implementing test suites for the language will be new, as these were also always provided for us. These may be tough simply because we are still not terribly strong OCaml programmers.
