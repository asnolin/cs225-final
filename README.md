CS 225 Final Project
Simply Typed Lambda Calculus with Exceptions

The code we are working on is in a file called project.ml.
It is located in the main directory, /cs225-final/.

To build, run an initial 'make' command, then 'make project.ml'
in the project directory.

We are implementing the simply typed lambda calculus as a base
language and extending it with the exception terms error, trap error,
raise exception, and trap exception.

We will demonstrate the divide by 0 exception as motivating the
need for this language.
